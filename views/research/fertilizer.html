                    <p>The first fertilization is a lexicon that develops a new vocabulary for the affordances of plant, machine, and human sensing. Drawn from fields like plant neurobiology, ecological economics, media philosophy, and engineering, the lexicon is meant to provoke new design imaginaries.

<h2 id="-about-">[ About ]</h2>

<p>Lexicons are fertilizer for new fields of inquiry. New ways of doing require new ways of perceiving and describing. This project is an effort to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Explore the overlaps of plant and machine intelligence to outline new loci for scenario generation and speculative design</li>
  <li>Gather insights from anthropologists, philosophers, ethologists, and plant neurobiologists to re-examine the relationships between nature, culture, and technology</li>
  <li>Envision transitions that align new ways of life to the earth’s metabolism, to its ceaseless negentropy</li>
  <li>Move away from exclusively human-centred concerns and towards a broader composition of heterogeneous actors</li>
</ul>

<p>It consists of terms drawn from a range of research fields and juxtaposed in alphabetical order. Users and plant conspirators are encouraged to submit signals to our <a href="https://www.are.na/from-later/office-of-cyber-botanicals">research repository on Are.na</a>, or reach out to us with thoughts.</p>

<p>Fertilizer is a research platform for future activations. The terms are meant to generate further projects across design, art, science, engineering, and more.</p>

<h2 id="-context-">[ Context ]</h2>

<p>Humans have never been the only planetary intelligence. While we are building planetary-scale systems of computation and calculation that exhibit certain kinds of intelligence — ones that can effectively mimic human modes of writing, visually identify objects with higher degrees of accuracy than their human counterparts, and beat humans in domain-constrained games with inhumanly beautiful styles of play – what we call the natural world is already filled with complex forms of communication, processing, creativity, and intelligence.</p>

<p>Animals, from vertebrates to invertebrates, corvids to cephalopods, each demonstrate forms of intelligence tightly linking what they sense to how they interact with their environments. Plants, too, sense, process, and signal. But more so than animals, their worlds are utterly foreign to ours. They are <em>sessile</em> (immobile), <em>autotrophic</em> (producing their own food), and <em>perpetually morphogenetic</em> (never stopping their growth) — with the caveat that for every rule, an exception can be found.</p>

<p>It is these very characteristics that make them important for imagining other worlds, in which the mutual entanglement of plant and machine intelligence can be a source of inspiration, a modality for extended and remote sensing, a field for modelling and simulation, and a domain for mutual actuation.</p>

<p>Exploring these entanglements is not about communicating with plants, controlling them, or projecting our aspirations onto them. It’s about interfacing with their already complex forms of phytosemiosis and cultivating an art of noticing their strangeness – a strangeness that is just as foreign as our own cultivation of machine intelligence, and just as foreign as our own perpetually redefined humanness.</p>

<p>This lexicon asks how we might shift the frame of speculative design to activate futures of more-than-human intelligence and design for users to come.</p>

<h4 id="acoustic-observatories">Acoustic Observatories</h4>

<p>The use of acoustic sensors to monitor environmental processes, such as an Australian project (<a href="https://acousticobservatory.org/">2017</a>) using 400 solar-powered audio sensors across the continent and accessible 24/7 online, or projects like Rainforest Connection’s (<a href="https://rfcx.org/">2013</a>) use of discarded cell phones to monitor illegal deforestation in the Amazon.</p>

<h4 id="adaptive-cycles">Adaptive Cycles</h4>

<p>A model for describing ecological resilience developed by C. S. Holling (<a href="https://www.resalliance.org/adaptive-cycle">1986</a>) in which systems are always in states of disequilibrium, between phases of growth or exploitation, conservation, collapse or release, and reorganization.</p>

<h4 id="age-of-entanglement">Age of Entanglement</h4>

<p>A post-Enlightenment era described by Danny Hillis (<a href="https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/enlightenment-to-entanglement">2016</a>) in which technologies, social structures, and natural processes interact as complex adaptive systems with difficult-to-disentangle elements, rather than as discrete simple machines.</p>

<h4 id="agricultural-printing">Agricultural Printing</h4>

<p>An exploration by Benedikt Groß (<a href="https://benedikt-gross.de/projects/avena-test-bed-agricultural-printing-and-altered-landscapes">2013</a>) of the potential of digital technologies and programmed landscapes for farming, in which precision targeting and personalization rather than scale and homogeneity guide planting.</p>

<h4 id="analog-computing">Analog Computing</h4>

<p>As distinct from digital computing, analog systems operate with real numbers, non-deterministic logic, and continuous functions, embodying complexity in their network topology rather than in code that controls the system; explored by John von Neumann (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/578873">1958</a>) in assessing parallels and disjunctions between nervous systems and computers.</p>

<h4 id="applied-nature">Applied Nature</h4>

<p>Efforts to harness plants’ and other natural beings’ innate sensing capabilities to monitor and respond to changes in environments, such as DARPA efforts (<a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/advanced-plant-technologies">2017</a>) to develop augmented plants as early warning signs of biochemical hazards and weapons.</p>

<h4 id="artificial-agency">Artificial Agency</h4>

<p>Political scientist David Runciman’s call (<a href="https://hbr.org/podcast/2020/01/superintelligence-already-rules-the-world">2018</a>) to pay more attention to the “artificial” in artificial intelligence and look at the array of already existing artificial intelligences like states and corporations that sense, process information, and pursue goals distinct from humans; described by Danny Hillis as hybrid intelligences (<a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/w_daniel_hillis-emergences">2019</a>).</p>

<h4 id="asperity">Asperity</h4>

<p>Term used by Jay Springett (<a href="https://thejaymo.net/asperity/">2013</a>) to describe future calls for coercive, drastic, and unequal reductions in consumption and emissions as a response to climate change, akin to the deployment of austerity policies after the financial crisis.</p>

<h4 id="astonishing-hypothesis">Astonishing Hypothesis</h4>

<p>Hypothesis that consciousness and intelligence emerge immanently from matter itself, requiring no special substance or spirit, by Francis Crick (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Astonishing_Hypothesis">1994</a>); extended by Frank Wilczek (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07735.pdf">2015</a>) to argue that all natural intelligences are simply a subset of artificial intelligence.</p>

<h4 id="atmospheric-laboratories">Atmospheric Laboratories</h4>

<p>A global network of scientific stations, including a ring of stations around the Arctic and mobile cruise ships hosting sensing equipment (<a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11599002/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/ocean-research-done-cruise-ships/">2000</a>), that collect the data necessary for modelling our understanding of atmospheric change.</p>

<h4 id="automation-substitution">Automation Substitution</h4>

<p>The use of human-designed artifacts as substitutes for ecological roles held by disappearing species, such as the use of submarine robots to eliminate coral-reef-damaging starfish (<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/sea-star-murdering-robotsa-are-deployed-in-great-barrier-reef-180970177/">2018</a>), or the “flash forests” mentioned below, substituting drones for the seed dispersal of birds.</p>

<h4 id="bestial-media-archaeology">Bestial Media Archaeology</h4>

<p>Research program articulated by Jussi Parikka (<a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/insect-media">2010</a>) to examine the relationships between animal behaviours and the design of technologies, in particular the parallels between the swarm behaviour of insects and parallel processing in computation.</p>

<h4 id="biomimetics">Biomimetics</h4>

<p>Inspired by nature in the design of form, function, or system; engineering roots in aeronautics, with dirigible pioneer George Cayley noting (<a href="https://www.j2mcl-planeurs.net/dbj2mcl/planeurs-biblio/fac-similes/On_aerial_navigation_(Cayley_1809).pdf">1809</a>) “nature is a better architect than man”; term itself coined by Otto H. Schmitt (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1664643/">1950s</a>), whose study of squid neurons inspired electronic circuits that transform analog to digital signals, still in use in most electronic devices today.</p>

<h4 id="bioregenerative-life-support-systems-blsss">Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLSSs)</h4>

<p>Explorations funded by NASA from the <a href="https://sciences.ucf.edu/class/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2017/02/Wheeler_AgricultureForSpace_PeoplePlaces_OpenAgriculture_2017.pdf">1960s</a> to build multi-species life support systems for space travel that replaced technologies by mimicking Earthly systems, centred initially on the use of algae for generating oxygen, removing waste, and providing food.</p>

<h4 id="bioregioning">Bioregioning</h4>

<p>Term by John Thackara (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405872619300012">2019</a>) to orient a design program around the shared purpose of aligning urban systems and their supporting technospheres to local and bioregional topographies of energy and matter.</p>

<h4 id="centres-of-calculation">Centres of Calculation</h4>

<p>Bruno Latour’s term (<a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn%3D9780674792913">1987</a>) for processes of knowledge production in the colonial era, when objects (plants, artifacts, etc.) would be made mobile, stable, and combinable so they could be taken back from colonies for study, which enabled the creation of tools for the exertion of power at a distance.</p>

<h4 id="chthonic-sensing">Chthonic Sensing</h4>

<p>The chthonic realm, or underworld, is a world inhabited by the complex symbiotic structures of plant roots, mycelia, bacteria, and insects that make up the “wood-wide web” (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/28764">1998</a>) of communication and resource distribution underneath forests, and remain largely illegible to contemporary sensing technologies (<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/wood-wide-web-underground-network-microbes-connects-trees-mapped-first-time">2019</a>).</p>

<h4 id="chronophotography">Chronophotography</h4>

<p>Also known as time-lapse photography, chronophotography was used to capture the first documentation (<a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1hp9q">1898–1900</a>) of plant movement on film by Wilhelm Pfeffer, and, just like the telescope and microscope before it, made perceptible what had previously been invisible.</p>

<h4 id="citizen-naturalists">Citizen Naturalists</h4>

<p>A sub-group of citizen scientists, such as iNaturalist (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INaturalist">2008</a>), focused on distributed data gathering of the sightings, movements, and descriptions of natural organisms, and the building of knowledge infrastructures to share that information.</p>

<h4 id="climate-leviathan">Climate Leviathan</h4>

<p>A scenario of political theology by Joel Wainwright and Geoff Mann (<a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/2545-climate-leviathan">2018</a>) outlining a system of planetary sovereignty developed in response to climate change, invoking Hobbes’ Leviathan (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3207/3207-h/3207-h.htm">1651</a>) to describe a new ecological sovereign.</p>

<h4 id="collaborative-infrastructuring">Collaborative Infrastructuring</h4>

<p>A concept from Nordic participatory design, infrastructuring (<a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/DESI_a_00165">2012</a>) refers to the design not of singular objects or projects, but of ongoing sociomaterial assemblies of human and nonhuman elements for public use.</p>

<h4 id="colony-immortality">Colony Immortality</h4>

<p>The vast majority of animals exist as units rather than colonies in which individuality is lost; in plants, it’s the opposite. First understood by Jean Fabre (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Henri_Fabre">19th century</a>) and Roelof Oldeman (<a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642811920">1970s</a>), colonial architecture confers an indeterminate life span on organisms, limiting their lives only through unfavourable external conditions like earthquakes, drought, predators, etc.</p>

<h4 id="columbian-exchange">Columbian Exchange</h4>

<p>A period of widespread exchange of plants, animals, culture, populations, technologies, diseases, and ideas following Christopher Columbus’s <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/alfred-w-crosby-on-the-columbian-exchange-98116477/">1492</a> voyage; beginning of the globalization of crops like potato, maize, tomato, tobacco, rice, citrus, coffee, and chili peppers.</p>

<h4 id="commensal-domestication">Commensal Domestication</h4>

<p>Of the three evolutionary pathways to domestication (the others being the prey pathway and the directed pathway), commensal is the most symbiotic, granting a form of agency to the species being domesticated through the benefits it receives; includes certain plant species (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3191">12,000 BCE</a>), including ones that have evolved to mimic domesticated species without providing human benefit.</p>

<h4 id="comparative-planetology">Comparative Planetology</h4>

<p>The study of the relationship between visual imaginations of the Earth and geopolitical responses to climate change, articulated by Lukáš Likavčan (<a href="https://strelkamag.com/en/article/introduction-to-comparative-planetology">2019</a>) to describe the implicit politics and potentials of the figures used when representing the Earth.</p>

<h4 id="copernican-traumas">Copernican Traumas</h4>

<p>The notion articulated by Freud (<a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/copernicus-darwin-and-freud-a-tale-of-science-and-narcissism/">1920</a>) that certain revolutions in scientific understanding, such as the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions, produce traumas by decentring the human, a process continuing with today’s advances in artificial intelligence (<a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300065121/fourth-discontinuity">1987</a>, <a href="https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/outing-a-i-beyond-the-turing-test/">2015</a>).</p>

<h4 id="cosmopolitan-localism">Cosmopolitan Localism</h4>

<p>A political alternative to globalization that emerged in the <a href="https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Cosmopolitan_Localism">1990s</a> and is built off distributed notions of developing local productive capacities alongside shared global knowledge infrastructures, and central to the work of design theorist Ezio Manzini (<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-when-everybody-designs">2015</a>).</p>

<h4 id="cosmotechnics">Cosmotechnics</h4>

<p>Cosmotechnics is Yuk Hui’s term (<a href="https://www.urbanomic.com/book/question-concerning-technology-china/">2016</a>) for the ways cosmological systems shape how technologies are developed and deployed. It stands against a technological essentialism that would imagine technologies as only developing along a single path of increasing complexity.</p>

<h4 id="crystals-as-genes-hypothesis">Crystals-as-Genes Hypothesis</h4>

<p>Put forward by organic chemist Graham Cairns-Smith (<a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-04-idea-synthesis-clays-metabolism.html">1966</a>), the hypothesis explains the emergence of life-like processes before molecules like DNA by looking to clay crystals, which grow, divide, and inherit the traits and patterns of their genitors much like life does.</p>

<h4 id="cuisinovores">Cuisinovores</h4>

<p>Argument put forward by primatologist Richard Wrangham (<a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/richard-wrangham/catching-fire/9780465020416/">2009</a>) that cooking, by making energy more bioavailable, was the evolutionary step change required for energy-intensive brains like humans’, highlighting connections between energy concentration and intelligence.</p>

<h4 id="decision-forest">Decision Forest</h4>

<p>Technique in computer science (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/598994">1995</a>), common in machine learning (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/decisionForests_MSR_TR_2011_114.pdf">2016</a>), which combines multiple decision trees to improve aggregate predictive performance; used for tasks like classification, regression, and survival analysis.</p>

<h4 id="deep-time">Deep Time</h4>

<p>The notion that Earth is many magnitudes of order older than human scales (<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-science-figured-out-the-age-of-the-earth/">4.55 billion years</a>), first put forward by Scottish geologist James Hutton (<a href="https://archive.org/details/agesinchaosjames0000unse/page/142">18th century</a>) by examining deposited layers of strata, a process of sorting and inscription that has been described as homologous to computation by Manuel DeLanda (<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/thousand-years-nonlinear-history">1997</a>).</p>

<h4 id="dematerialization">Dematerialization</h4>

<p>The tendency observed by some economists that the total use of materials to achieve the same outcomes and meet the same needs drops over time, currently expounded by Andrew McAfee (<a href="https://andrewmcafee.org/more-from-less/overivew">2019</a>) and linked to “ephemeralization” in R.

<h4 id="plant-rights">Plant Rights</h4>

<p>The use of legal mechanisms to extend inalienable rights to plants, popularized by a Swiss ethics committee report (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2634081/">2008</a>) that interpreted the constitution as extending dignity to plants, but not granting them outright rights for fear it would slow scientific progress.</p>

<h2 id="-ways-to-use-">[ Ways to use ]</h2>

<p>There are as many ways to use the lexicon as there are combinations of terms within them. Here, we highlight three ways they could function:</p>

<p><strong>1/</strong> This lexicon is an ongoing project to develop a new vocabulary at the intersection of plant and machine intelligence. It is oriented towards design in an expanded sense of the term, including the activity of scientists, engineers, writers, strategists, and artists. It draws from a range of fields – from plant neurobiology to speculative design, artificial intelligence to geomorphology, media theory to ecological economics.</p>

<p>From these fields it extracts a range of terms. Some of the terms are <em>concepts</em>, some describe <em>processes</em>, while others are simply singular <em>things</em>. This heterogeneity of terms – in the fields they come from and the forms they take – is important. A lexicon is arranged arbitrarily, in the sense of alphabetically. Terms that have no relation to one another in field or form can suddenly find themselves in proximity, in communication.</p>

<p>Combining disparate terms can allow for the construction of new diagrams – one could, for instance, draw a circuit between an unrelated concept and a process to generate a new speculative entity. Or combine an entity and a process to incubate a new concept. In that sense, <strong>the lexicon is a machine for speculative diagramming</strong>. A tool to imagine new worlds.</p>

<p><strong>2/</strong> The terms operate at various scales. Some are geographic – certain terms apply globally while others are resolutely local; some operate on an infraindividual scale while others accelerate and spread rapidly across the transindividual.</p>

<p>Other scales are temporal – some terms rise from the histories of deep time in the first glimmers of life itself, while others exist in a not-yet-actualized future that is nevertheless retroactively shaping the present; some have operated for thousands of years, while others will flash into and out of existence, never to re-emerge.</p>

<p>As media and design theorist Benjamin Bratton has described, these two axes, of temporal and geographic scales – long and short timescales, large and small spatial scales – outline a matrix for speculative design. Placed perpendicularly, the two axes create four quadrants, none of which is necessarily more significant than the others. A global intervention spanning centuries might not be any more transformative than a completely localized and momentary one. But neither is a localized, momentary intervention to be lauded as inherently more progressive than a durable global one.</p>

<p>In that sense, <strong>the lexicon is an ethico-aesthetic bridge across scales</strong>. A way to build alliances across a multiplicity of interventions and modalities.</p>

<p><strong>3/</strong> When the word “individual” is used, it isn’t meant in the sense of a human individual, or not only. The commonsensical notion of an individual as a singular human is not enough. There are many kinds of individuals.</p>

<p>An individual is any consistency of heterogeneous parts held over time, as elaborated by philosopher Manuel DeLanda. It’s an assemblage, its borders porous in space and time. One could speak of a society as an individual, a pack of animals as an individual, or a tree that reiterates endless copies of itself on its trunk as an individual. What matters is the consistency held by the parts over time, which produces a whole greater than the parts.</p>

<p>This matters because culture has over-indexed on human-centredness. It has targeted a reduced, abstracted, isolated notion of an individual as a single human being. In so doing, it has achieved tremendous effectiveness in some metrics – in intuitiveness, in convenience, in impulsivity. But in doing so, it has helped enable a range of unaccounted externalities, including environmental, social, and psychological damages. It has failed to adopt the flexible scales and complex understandings required to address 21st-century problems.</p>

<p>In that sense, <strong>the lexicon is an opening to what lies beyond human-centredness</strong>. It is a call to take seriously the strangeness of other intelligences and needs, and to begin thinking about the design of more-than-human futures.</p>

<h2 id="-thoughts-on-sensing-">[ Thoughts on sensing ]</h2>

<p>Plants and machines – how differently we’ve imagined their capacities for intelligence over time.</p>

<p>We’ve fantasized about machines becoming intelligent for thousands of years. Some of the earliest written traces document this, like Homer’s description of Hephaestus, the Greek god of invention, living luxuriously in his proto-smart home – with its automated gates and forges, driverless delivery bots, autonomous servants, and machine-generated music. Meanwhile, plants have been variously denigrated and ignored, relegated to an invisible background condition, a lower rung on the pyramid of life – alive but not sentient, and certainly not intelligent.</p>

<p>Plants were forgotten even on the venerable Noah’s Ark. Had Noah’s program to restore the globe’s ecology been carried out as designed, it would have resulted in a rather temporary repopulation, as an increasingly putrid mass of animal flesh fought for the rapidly diminishing scraps of the last negentropic stores of energy – each others’ bodies. Lacking the autotrophic ability of plants to transform solar energy into chemical energy, all animal life would vanish from the world after a short but intensely non-aromatic carnival of negative-sum calorie depreciation.</p>

<p>Of course, this plant-blindness has not been constant across all places and times. Various cultures, practices, and knowledges have given more or less weight to the agential capacity of plants. Most recently, the modern scientific tradition has itself – not without controversy – begun to reverse its view of a mute botanous universe. It has seen the inauguration of fields like plant neurobiology, which studies the parallels between the neuronal structures of animals and the root systems of plants, a parallel noted by none other than Darwin himself.</p>

<p>Plants, like all living things, must be able to sense, process, and respond to a changing environment if they wish to survive. The extent and fury of this semiotic exchange has been underestimated until recently. In fact, it could turn out that life and semiosis emerge at the same time and for the same reasons – any living thing must be able to process signs from its environment. The mechanisms by which even the “dumbest” of simple cells sense and process information remain barely catalogued, while the scope of both knowns and known unknowns in their functioning steadily grows.</p>

<p>As our awareness of the scope of life’s capacity to communicate within and between individuals continues to grow, we should stop to note that what’s being described are forms of non-linguistic communication. There is no “language” of plants, nor any interest in resurrecting dubious metaphors extending language everywhere. But there is an exchange of signs of various kinds – indexes pointing to states and changes in the environment and icons mirroring them topographically. Plants’ most robust sensing is chemical, but they also have multiple photoreceptors, the ability to sense touch, gravity, humidity, and proprioception. Plants process and respond to these signs in complex ways, producing emergent intelligences that can’t be reduced to mute matter any more than humans’ own use of signs elsewhere on the semiotic continuum.</p>

<p>Plants’ evolved forms of intelligence – of sensing and responding non-deterministically to their environments – only make sense if we step out of our human and zoocentric perspectives. Able to generate chemical energy from solar capture, they have evolved body plans to maximize surface area but make mobility impractical. Their sessility – rootedness in fixed location – exposes them to the predation of mobile creatures, generating a range of creative adaptations, including the production of an endless array of pharmacological compounds to manipulate animals, impressive forms of mimicry and camouflage, the distribution of organs and functions throughout the body, various forms of natural genetic engineering, and the creation of symbiotic alliances with pollinators (such as birds and bees), defenders (such as ants), and network managers (such as fungi).</p>

<p>While none of these evolutionary inheritances is the result of plant intelligence, they set the context for understanding the <em>Umwelt</em> – the perceptual worlds experienced by an organism – of plant life. With a different set of defences, sources of energy, and bodily plans, the sensory arrangements of plants are geared towards entirely different ends than mobile creatures. Just because their intelligence doesn’t mirror our own doesn’t mean theirs doesn’t exist, nor does it mean we have to jettison the only terms and metaphors – based on our own bodily forms and needs – that we have to make sense of them.</p>

<p>A metaphor can be a bridge taking us to a new form of understanding. The provocation to take plant intelligence seriously alerts us to the complexity of their behaviour, but only if we don’t project our own measures and modes onto them.</p>

<p>It is, in that sense, the same problem confronting us when we think about machine intelligence. If we don’t want innovation to be boring rehashes of ancient smart home fantasies, might we adopt a lesson from the resolute strangeness and alterity of plant intelligence when trying to conceptualize machine intelligence? Instead of androids in human form serving masters, shouldn’t we begin from the premise that how and what a system senses will set the foundation for what its intelligence could even be? Why is the human the only measure? Doesn’t this blind us to the ways machine intelligence is <em>already</em> here, in many of our daily interactions? Doesn’t this blind us to what it could <em>become</em>?</p>
