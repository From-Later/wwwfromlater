    <h2>[ Scenario ]</h2>
    <p>
        In the near future Compersia scenario, a confluence of socio-economic and technological factors are changing the nature of adulthood. People expect their lives to be more transient—dynamic and fluid rather than stable and consistent. Milestones like marriage, parenthood, and home-ownership are delayed due to economic necessity or altogether discarded by a values hierarchy that prioritizes gratification over tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
        A generation disillusioned with the institution of marriage views monogamy with realism and handles relationships with pragmatism. Having grown up in fragmented homes, their baggage equips them to seriously acknowledge the obvious: that even “committed life-partner relationships” are temporary. And, as products of the Social Internet, they’re accustomed to abundance of choice, and expect the same kind of optionality in matters of love. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Through the ‘20s, a cambrian explosion of relationship types set tradition into flux. En masse, people began establishing their own unique polycules, multi-layered complex structures of kinship and non-monogamous romance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Meanwhile, conservative values sought to protect the fideliti-normative home. Commentators criticised the polyamorous lifestyle as not only immoral, but also unfeasible. Maintaining a healthy two-person relationship was challenging enough. Managing the needs and desires of many partners in a complex polycule was just a recipe for drama. Or so went the argument.
