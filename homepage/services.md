  ## Our partners trust us to break down complexity, prioritize what’s important, identify high-value opportunities, and frame clear choices, so they can make better bets.

# Foresight is the craft of sensing and responding to complex, uncertain possibilities.

We work with organizations looking to understand how their role in the world is changing. Our partners include global companies, SMEs, startups, VCs, cooperatives, arts organizations, NGOs, and governmental bodies. Our approach to strategic foresight is rigorous and non-dogmatic. We judiciously apply the appropriate sequence of methods to solve the challenge at hand.

At our core is a research-driven approach to creation and strategy. We take the time to frame and reframe problems and their iterative solutions.

We believe in a world of distributed, resilient agents increasing their capacity for collective action. To that end, we strive to make our tools, processes, and knowledge open and available – while also working with clients, applying the tools and methods of strategic foresight to their unique needs and situations.
