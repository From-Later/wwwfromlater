## [ About ]

This lexicon is an ongoing project to develop a new vocabulary at the intersection of plant and machine intelligence. It is oriented towards design in an expanded sense of the term, including the activity of scientists, engineers, writers, strategists, and artists. It draws from a range of fields – from plant neurobiology to speculative design, artificial intelligence to geomorphology, media theory to ecological economics.

From these fields it extracts a range of terms. Some of the terms are concepts, some describe processes, while others are simply singular things. This heterogeneity of terms – in the fields they come from and the forms they take – is important. A lexicon is arranged arbitrarily, in the sense of alphabetically. Terms that have no relation to one another in field or form can suddenly find themselves in proximity, held in potential for transversal communication.

Combining disparate terms can allow for the construction of new diagrams – one could, for instance, draw a circuit between an unrelated concept and a process to generate a new speculative entity. Or combine an entity and a process to incubate a new concept. In that sense, the lexicon is a machine for speculative diagramming. A tool to imagine new circuits and worlds.

## [ The Space of Possible Intelligences ]

Plants and machines – how differently we’ve imagined their capacities for intelligence over time.

We’ve fantasized about machines becoming intelligent for thousands of years. Some of the earliest written traces document this, like Homer’s description of Hephaestus, the Greek god of invention, living luxuriously in his proto-smart home – with its automated gates and forges, driverless delivery bots, autonomous servants, and machine generated music. Meanwhile, plants have been variously denigrated and ignored, relegated to an invisible background condition, a lower rung on the pyramid of life – alive but not sentient, and certainly not intelligent.

Plants were forgotten even on the venerable Noah’s Ark. Had Noah's program to restore the globe’s ecology been carried out as designed, it would have resulted in a rather temporary repopulation, as an increasingly putrid mass of animal flesh fought for the rapidly diminishing scraps of the last negentropic stores of energy – each others’ bodies. Lacking the autotrophic ability of plants to transform solar energy into chemical energy, all animal life would vanish from the world after a short but intensely non-aromatic carnival of negative-sum calorie depreciation.

Of course, this plant-blindness has not been constant across all places and times. Various cultures, practices, and knowledges have given more or less weight to the agential capacity of plants. Most recently, the modern scientific tradition has itself – not without controversy – begun to reverse its view of a mute botanous universe. It has seen the inauguration of fields like plant neurobiology, which study the parallels between the neuronal structures of animals and the root systems of plants, a parallel noted by none other than Darwin himself.

Plants, like all living things, must be able to sense, process, and respond to a changing environment if they wish to survive. The extent and fury of this semiotic exchange has been underestimated until recently. In fact, it could turn out that life and semiosis emerge at the same time and for the same reasons – any living thing must be able to process signs from its environment. The mechanisms by which even the ‘dumbest’ of simple cells sense and process information remain barely catalogued, while the scope of both knowns and known unknowns in their functioning steadily grows.

As our awareness of the scope of life’s capacity to communicate within and between individuals continues to grow, we should stop to note that what’s being described are forms of non-linguistic communication. There is no ‘language’ of plants, nor any interest in resurrecting dubious metaphors extending language everywhere. What there is an exchange of signs of various kinds – indexes pointing to states and changes in the environment and icons mirroring them topographically. Plants' most robust sensing is chemical, but they also have multiple photoreceptors, the ability to sense touch, gravity, humidity, and proprioception. Plants process and respond to these signs in complex ways, producing emergent intelligences that can’t be reduced to mute matter any more than humans’ own use of signs elsewhere on the semiotic continuum.

Plants' evolved forms of intelligence – of sensing and responding non-deterministically to their environments – only make sense if we step out of our human and zoocentric perspectives. Able to generate chemical energy from solar capture, they have evolved body plans to maximize surface area but make mobility impractical. Their sessility – rooted in fixed location – exposes them to the predation of mobile creature, generating a range of creative adaptations, including the production of an endless array of pharmacological compounds to manipulate animals, impressive forms of mimicry and camouflage, the distribution of organs and functions throughout the body, various forms of natural genetic engineering, and the creation of symbiotic alliances with pollinators (such as birds and bees), defenders (such as ants), and network managers (such as fungi).

While none of these evolutionary inheritances is the result of plant intelligence, they set the context for understanding the Umwelt – the perceptual worlds experienced by an organism – of plant life. With a different set of defences, sources of energy, and bodily plans, the sensory arrangement of plants are geared towards entirely different ends than mobile creatures. Just because their intelligence doesn’t mirror our own doesn’t mean theirs doesn't exist, nor does it mean we have to jettison the only terms and metaphors – based on our own bodily forms and needs – that we have to make sense of them.

A metaphor can be a bridge taking us to a new form of understanding. The provocation to take seriously plant intelligence alerts us to the complexity of their behaviour, but only if we don’t project our own measures and modes onto them.

It is, in that sense, the same problem confronting us when we are thinking about machine intelligence. If we don’t want innovation to be boring rehashes of ancient smart home fantasies, might we adopt a lesson from the resolute strangeness and alterity of plant intelligence when trying to conceptualize machine intelligence? Instead of androids in human form serving masters, shouldn’t we begin from the premise that how and what a system senses will set the foundation for what its intelligence could even be? Why is the human the only measure? Doesn’t this blind us to the ways machine intelligence is already here, in many of our daily interactions? Doesn’t this blind us to what it could become?

#### Chthonic Sensing

The chthonic, or underworld, is a world inhabited by the complex symbiotic structures of plant roots, mycelium, bacteria and insects that make up the ‘wood wide web’ (1998) of communication and resource distribution underneath forests, and remain largely illegible to contemporary sensing technologies (2019).

#### Endosymbiosis

Also known as symbiogenesis, this evolutionary theory (1967) describes the emergence of organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts as the collaborative merging of separate organisms, shifting notions of evolution away from exclusively competitive drives.

#### Epizoic Media

From epizoons – parasitic animals – a term developed and documented by Theun Karelse and others during the (2010s) to highlight the increasing outfitting of animals and plants with rich technological media.

#### Eugenic Algorithms

Term from Christina Cogdell (2018) to describe how genetic algorithms – an optimization heuristic inspired by natural selection – and generative design in general, have inherited a shared vocabulary and an abstract set of practices from early 20th century eugenics.

#### Exaptation

Evolutionary term (1982) for characteristics that didn’t evolve as adaptations through natural selection, but were nevertheless repurposed to enhance fitness; exaptation has itself been repurposed to explore the evolutionary dynamics of technological innovation (2016).

#### Extended Mind

Notion that cognition is embodied not just in a brain or body, but for eg. in external objects like pen and paper, without which humans couldn’t do logic, as described by Clark and Chalmers (1995); taken up in AI research by figures like Rodney Brooks, in paying more attention to the hardware ‘body’ and affordances of the environment.

#### FarmOS

Open-source projects for farm management, planning, and record keeping (2017), designed as generalizable platforms for developers to extend.

#### Forest Gardening

An ancient form of food production and agroforestry system (10,000-100,000 BCE) that produces fruits, nuts, herbs, vines, and vegetables, archaeological evidence of which points to areas like the Amazon as once being a massive experiment in forest gardening.

#### General Economy

Attempt by George Bataille (1949) to turn economics away from a foundation in scarcity towards one in abundance and excess – from the sun whose excess energy and waste is the foundation for photosynthesis and life, to human societies who waste in war and entertainment, excess rather than scarcity is key to understanding economies of circulation.

#### The Great Silence

The phenomena of not finding any signs of other life or intelligence in the universe, also known as the Fermi paradox (1950s), allegorized by sci-fi writer Ted Chiang (2016) to ask why, even on this Earth, we’ve barely recognized the existence of other intelligent species.

#### Green Militarization

Refers to the increasing use of military and paramilitary forces, technologies, and partnerships to address conservation efforts and other environmental enforcement mechanisms (2014).

#### Half Earth

A proposal by biologist Edward O. Wilson (2016) to divide the world into two zones – one inhabitable by humans, the other excluding them entirely to facilitate biodiversity recovery.

#### Holobiont Design

A holobiont is the composite organism of a host and its microbiome, increasingly a site for design interventions; examples include the nitrogen-fixing bacteria in legumes’ root systems, whose symbiosis is being exported to other plants using CRISPR-Cas9 (2017), in an effort to reduce overfertilisation externalities made common by the Green Revolution (1960s).

#### Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT)

Contrary to the notion that genes can only flow down from parents to offspring, much of evolutionary history has consisted of sideways exchanges of genes across species and kingdom boundaries; this form of natural genetic engineering has prompted molecular biologist W. Ford Doolittle (2000) to question the very notion of a ‘tree’ of life, with its clean notions of descent.

#### Human-to-Plant Transition

Biohacking a species transition to plants as undergone by members of Quimera Rosa (2016), injecting themselves with chlorophyll tattoos and RFID chips; inspired by Lynn Margulis’ (2007) notion of a homo photosyntheticus that generates energy with scalp-based algae.

#### Meteorological Reformation

Peter Sloterdijk’s parallel (2010) between the Reformation’s (16th century) break with theological teachings, and the break with present-day lifestyles necessitated by climate, with meteorologists playing the role of dissenting theologists.

#### Multispecies Diplomacy

A call for introducing human-like institutional arrangements into the natural world, such as Latour’s Parliament of Things (1991) in which non-human entities and hybrids can be represented, or his call for diplomats of multinaturalism (2004) rather than multiculturalism.

#### Nagoya Protocol

The use of automation technologies, such as the AI frameworks used in self-driving cars, to manage novel ecosystems free from human intervention (2017), rather than restoring them to past wild states; critically examined by artistic works like Asunder (2019), an autonomous land use management system.

#### Nonhuman Census

The use of tools like Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (2000), for assessing infrared reflections of flora, along with depth sensors and machine learning (2018), to build increasingly detailed accounts of global flora; can be related to Benedict Anderson’s discussion of the map, census, and museum (1991) as colonial tools of governance.

#### Ontographic Machines

A term from Ian Bogost (2012) describing techniques for experiencing and inhabiting the being of otherness and objects; exemplified by artistic projects like Umwelt Microbiana (2017) by Joel Ong and Mick Lorusso, which invites participants into a microbially-sensed world.

#### Oxygen Catastrophe

The first mass extinction event on Earth (2,500,000,000,000 BCE) caused by the rise of cyanobacteria (or algae, the origin of plants) whose byproduct – oxygen – wiped out the vast majority of the world’s then abundant anaerobic bacteria over the course of 300 million years.

#### Physis Kryptesthai Philei

The cryptic 123rd fragment from Heraclitus (~500 BCE), translated as ‘nature loves to hide,’ has been the source of musing for philosophers from Aristotle to Saint Thomas Aquinas to Heidegger, seeking to understand the borders between the animate and inanimate.

#### Phytoncides

#### Plant Ocelli

The unproven theory by Gottlieb Haberlandt (1905) that plants have epidermal cells that function as real lenses (known as ocelli, common in invertebrates), transmitting visual information not only about light but shape and movement; could explain the mimicry capabilities of certain plants that have no other known mechanisms for copying their neighbors.

#### Plant Neurobiology

Academic field of study established (2005) to explore parallels between plant physiology and neural networks in animals; extends back to Darwin’s ‘root-brain hypothesis,’ (1880), and Democritus’ description of plants as ‘upside-down humans’ (400BCE).

#### Plant Rights

The use of legal mechanisms to extend inalienable rights to plants, popularized by a Swiss Ethics Committee report (2008) that interpreted the constitution as extending dignity to plants, but not granting them outright rights for fear it would slow scientific progress.

#### Plantoids

Automated machines, or robots, that mimic plants rather than humans (androids), first developed by Barbara Mazzolai and Stefano Mancuso (2011); they’re nearly immobile, decentralized in their sensing and processing, and generate their own energy and form.

The use of online platforms and their economic matchmaking capabilities to link crowd investors with regenerative agricultural initiatives, such as the Steward Farm Trust (2019).

#### Reproductive Morphology

The varied topology of plant reproduction, which can occur through cloning, grafting, apomixis (without fertilization), pollination, and double fertilization; plant sexual organs famously used for Linnaeus’ taxonomy (1753), for which he was condemned for immorality.

#### Ruderals

Plants that grow among waste ground or refuse; the first to return to abandoned lands, and whose initial terra-reforming sets the stage for successive waves of plant inhabitation; from the latin word for rubble (1855–60).

Supply chains that move goods from uncontrolled modes of production (aka not factories or farms) to the market, such as the trade in foraged foods, cottage industries for subcontracting clothing, etc. explored by anthropologist Anna Tsing (2015).

#### Seed Sovereignty

An effort by organizations like Via Campesina (1993) to ensure farmers’ rights to save, breed, and exchange open source seeds that are not owned or patented, restoring the diversity and variety of edible species, and backed by a United Nations declaration (2018) opposed by the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Hungary, Israel and Sweden.

#### Semiosphere

#### Sensory Substitution

//

#### Soft-Tech

Explored by Stewart Brand and Jay Baldwin during the (1970s) energy crises as decentralized renewable sources – small scale, self-sufficient, resilient, and adaptive systems; also used by author Jeff Vandermeer (2018) to talk about bio-derived materials.

A movement since the (2010s) across speculative fiction, art, design, and politics that seeks to envision the ethics and aesthetics of an optimistic, sustainable, post-fossil fuel world.

#### Species-Level Intelligence

Notion from Samuel Butler (1887) revived by Nils Barricelli’s computer simulation experiments with artificial life forms (1953), implying that random mutation and natural/sexual selection alone couldn’t account for the emergence of intelligence, without evoking a notion of design from above either.

#### Species Loneliness

An unnamed sense of isolation and sadness that stems from disconnection with other species and forms of kin (1993), demonstrated by the inability of many North Americans to identify even a handful of flora in their immediate environments (2013).

#### Speculative Time-Complex

The recursive operation of feedback between a model and the reality it models, as exemplified by financial models which don’t just represent predicted future-states but cause them to emerge; speculations by Armen Avanessian and Suhail Malik (2016) on whether recursivity can be used by other models of valuation, like climate modelling.

#### Stigmergy

A mechanism (1959) for coordinating the behavior of individual agents, without centralized control, by communicating through traces and changes to the environment, often studied in the context of insect swarms but equally applicable to plant roots.

#### Suberin Engineering

Research at the Salk Institute (2017) to use gene editing to increase the amount of suberin (the main component in non-biodegradable cork) produced by plants, in order to increase the amount of carbon stored in their root systems.

#### Subtractive Modernity

The gamble described by design theorist Benjamin Bratton (2016) for planetary-scale systems of computation to slingshot modernity into sustainable, resilient futures in which computation is geared towards lightening and subtracting the load on Earth’s systems.

#### Synthetic Silviculture

The modelling of trees and ecosystems inside of computational simulations (2019) to test future scenarios, understand complex systems, and guide environmental interventions in forestry management.

#### Technosphere

Engineer

#### Ubiety

Coined by interaction designer Bill Buxton (2019), to oppose ubiquity and ubiquitous computing (the condition of being everywhere at the same time), ubiety is a call to design for the particularity of place, for situated intelligences rather than universal situations.

#### Umwelt

Concept from theoretical biologist Jakob von Uexküll (1920) for describing the species-specific modelling of and access to their external worlds, as mediated by their perceptual organs and effectual capabilities.

#### Unconventional Computing

An applied field (1998) of interdisciplinary research exploring alternative substrates and mediums for computation, including slime molds, chemical gradients, water pressure, DNA, plants, and more, for sensing, storing, and processing information.

#### Universal Carnivory

Plant carnivory, controversially acknowledged by Darwin (1875), includes around 600 species known to attract, trap, and kill prey including small mammals like mice; recently, many more species have been acknowledged as protocarnivores (2002), such as potato and tobacco plants, who secrete poisonous substances to kill insects and indirectly absorb their waste products.

#### Vavilovian Mimicry

A form of plant mimicry in which an agricultural weed takes on the characteristics of a domesticated crop, due to selective pressures in the agricultural system (~10,000 BCE); one of the most famous occurs between lentils and common vetch, with the introduction of automated sorting through machine vision (1997) accelerating the rate and resolution of vetch mimicry.

#### Vegetal Paradox

Etymological paradox in which the origins of ‘vegetation’ in Middle Latin verbs (early 15th century) to signify growth, flourishing, aliveness, and activity, contradict contemporary use of the verb ‘to vegetate’ as passivity, described by philosopher Michael Marder (2013).

#### Virtual Geoeconomics

The use of proxy commodities to import/substitute for diminishing natural commodities in areas hit by climate change, such as the use of water to grow hay in the Arizona desert by a Saudi Arabian dairy company and exported back to the Middle East as ‘virtual water’ (2014).

#### Warm Data

The study of data in context, in situ, which focuses on the relationships between the elements of a complex, open-ended system, rather than their easy-to-measure, discrete components and individual characteristics, as developed by Nora Bateson (2012).

#### Xenodesign

Xeno, from foreignness or otherness, as an approach to design that moves beyond dominant human-centered approaches to explore the broader range of capacities and relations of a more-than-human world, as described by designer Johanna Schmeer (2019).

#### Zoöps

Explorations at Het Nieuwe Instituut (2019) for a new kind of organization, inspired by co-operatives, that supports non-human members, using legal mechanisms and new technologies to facilitate them.
