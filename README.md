# Websites for fromlater.com

From Later's websites are built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)â€“a markdown based simple static site generator.

## What's in this repository?
This repository currently contains Jekyll codebases for the following web domains:

1. `fromlater.com` (`www.fromlater.com` is also aliased), whose codebase can be found in [wwwfromlater/homepage](https://github.com/From-Later/wwwfromlater/tree/master/homepage)
2. `views.fromlater.com`, whose codebase can be found in [wwwfromlater/viewsfromlater](https://github.com/From-Later/wwwfromlater/tree/master/viewsfromlater)
3. `recordings.fromlater.com`, whose codebase can be found in [wwwfromlater/recordingsfromlater](https://github.com/From-Later/wwwfromlater/tree/master/recordingsfromlater)

The [wwwfromlater/shared](https://github.com/From-Later/wwwfromlater/tree/master/shared) directory contains code that is shared between the three websites
