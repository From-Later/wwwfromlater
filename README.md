# Websites for fromlater.com

From Later's websites are built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)â€“a markdown based simple static site generator.

## What's in this repository?
This repository currently contains Jekyll codebases for the following web domains:

1. `fromlater.com` (`www.fromlater.com` is also aliased), whose codebase can be found in [wwwfromlater/homepage](https://github.com/From-Later/wwwfromlater/tree/master/homepage)
2. `views.fromlater.com`, whose codebase can be found in [wwwfromlater/viewsfromlater](https://github.com/From-Later/wwwfromlater/tree/master/viewsfromlater)
3. `recordings.fromlater.com`, whose codebase can be found in [wwwfromlater/recordingsfromlater](https://github.com/From-Later/wwwfromlater/tree/master/recordingsfromlater)

The [wwwfromlater/shared](https://github.com/From-Later/wwwfromlater/tree/master/shared) directory contains code that is shared between the three websites

## Prerequisite to setup
* Be familiar with version control with Git and GitHub. See the [Software Carpentry online lessons](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) if you're a novice
* Check and make sure you [meet requirements to run Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). You'll need to have an appropriate version of Ruby installed

## Set up locally on your machine
1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/From-Later/wwwfromlater.git`
2. Navigate to any of the main web directories by first `cd wwwfromlater` and then `cd homepage`
3. Install with bundler `bundler install`
4. Build Jekyll code by `bundle exec jekyll build`
5. Serve locally by `bundle exec jekyll serve`
6. You should see a message like: 
```
Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```
7. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` on your browser to see if it worked

### Notes on versions
I find version and dependency management in Ruby confusing. Maybe helpful:
- I'm using Ruby version `2.7.4`
- You can use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage Ruby versions
  - List available ruby versions for installation: `rbenv install -l`
  - Install a Ruby version like this: `rbenv install 2.7.4`
  - See versions: `rbenv versions`
  - Change local version: `rbenv local 2.7.4`

### Known issue with ffi compilation
There's a known compilattion issue with the ffi gem, when compiling using an M1 architecture Mac chip.
```
[-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
    result = ffi_prep_closure(pcl, cif, callback, (void *)self);
             ^
```

A workaround is to run `bundle config --local build.ffi --with-cflags="-Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration"` before `bundler install`

## Contribution Guidelines
Everyone is welcome to make pull requests! Our process for accepting changes has a few steps:

1. If you haven't submitted anything before, start by cloning the repository. Organization members should clone the upsteam repo, instead of working from a fork:

        git clone https://github.com/From-Later/wwwfromlater.git

2. Create a new branch for the changes you want to work on. Choose a topic for your branch name that reflects the change:

        git checkout -b <branch-name>

3. Create or modify the files with your changes. If you want to show other people work that isn't ready to merge in, commit your changes then create a pull request (PR) with __WIP__ in the title.

        https://github.com/From-Later/wwwfromlater/pull/new/master

4. Once your changes are ready for final review, commit your changes then create or modify your PR.

5. Allow others sufficient time for review and comments before merging. For big changes, ping @uditvira to check over what you've done. There may be some fixes or adjustments you'll have to make based on feedback.

6. Once you have integrated comments, or waited for feedback, merge away!

## Deployment
- Visit AWS console for our [S3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/www.fromlater.com?region=us-east-1&tab=objects)
- Delete any files present and replace with files generated in your local `wwwfromlater/homepage/_site` directory
  - The website should be visible on [`http://www.fromlater.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/`](http://www.fromlater.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/)
- Make public
- Create invalidation in the [cloudfront distribution](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v3/home?region=us-east-1#/distributions/E2O540YJYY20OE) to force an update in the CDN

## TODO
- [ ] automate deploy pipeline
- [ ] Arena integration
