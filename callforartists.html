<h2 id="this-womxns-work">This Womxn’s Work</h2>
<p>Led by <a href="https://www.fromlater.com">From Later</a> and <a href="https://atthemomentonline.co/">At The Moment</a>, <em>This Womxn’s Work</em> will be a research-based exhibition exploring the past, present, and futures of womxn’s work in Toronto. Starting from a broad definition of work , including manual, cognitive, and emotional labour, we welcome submissions that consider expressions of women’s work through the prisms of class, gender, immigration, status, and race.</p>

<h4 id="themes-subjects-and-areas-of-inquiry-may-include">Themes, subjects, and areas of inquiry may include:</h4>
<p>/ the politics and economics of unpaid care work<br />
/ the historical and potential future role of women in manufacturing and construction<br />
/ the relationship between labour gaps and immigration policy<br />
/ the deskilling, reskilling, and upskilling of highly-trained newcomer women<br />
/ gender parity and wage gap in the corporate work environment<br />
/ automation of routine cognitive work in clerical support and service roles where women predominate<br />
/ women’s roles in emerging high-growth fields such as professional, scientific, and technical services<br />
/ increasing demand for social and emotional skills in the workforce<br />
/ women’s role in entrepreneurship (and disproportionate access to venture capital)<br />
/ women’s participation in the gig economy, flexible and remote work (including e-commerce entrepreneurship)</p>

<h3 id="1-process">1/ Process</h3>
<p>Artists of all media are invited to submit proposals that respond to the notion of women’s work and the immigrant/newcomer experience.</p>

<p>From Later will lead the research process that informs the project. We will provide initial insights
on the historical trajectory of women’s work, as well as emerging signals, trends, and drivers of
change that may influence how the futures of women’s work might unfold.</p>

<p>Three selected artists will work collaboratively with From Later and At the Moment to develop
their expressions of women’s work in response to the initial research. We anticipate a close
collaborative relationship with creative work sessions to take place in Toronto throughout
December 2019 and January 2020.</p>

<p>This Womxn’s Work will feature the three artists’ work as part of an exhibit to be presented at
<a href="http://www.myseumoftoronto.com/program/myseum-intersections/">Myseum: Intersections in April 2020</a>.</p>

<h3 id="2-outputs">2/ Outputs</h3>
<p>Artistic outputs may express or comment on (but will not be limited to):</p>

<p>/ the sounds of work<br />
/ images of work-in-progress<br />
/ places and spaces of work<br />
/ artifacts or remnants of work (uniforms, tools &amp; materials)<br />
/ behaviours and affordances related to work<br />
/ making, manufacturing, or construction (acts of work and labour, manual labour)<br />
/ cognitive and emotional labour<br />
/ modes of collaboration, working together, working alone together<br />
/ wages and compensation, evaluations, documenting hours of work<br />
/ tools for managing roles, responsibilities, tasks<br />
/ articulations of work values, work ethic</p>

<h3 id="3-site">3/ Site</h3>
<p>Artists will be working with the project team to integrate research and creative outputs to create a site-specific installation experience. Location to be announced.</p>
